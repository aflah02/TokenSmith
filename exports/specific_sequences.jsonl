She said, \"Why are you crying, children? You can both have a turn on the slide, but you need to use wisdom and be clever. Do you know what wisdom and clever mean?\" Lily and Ben shook their heads. They did not know those words. The lady said, \"Wisdom means you know what is good and what is bad, and you choose what is good.
